# Description



The **CyberMetric Dataset** introduces a new benchmarking tool consisting of 10,000 questions designed to evaluate the cybersecurity knowledge of various Large Language Models (LLMs) within the cybersecurity domain. This dataset is created using different LLMs and has been verified by human experts in the cybersecurity field to ensure its relevance and accuracy. The dataset is compiled from various sources including standards, certifications, research papers, books, and other publications within the cybersecurity field.  We provide the dataset in three distinct sizes —small, medium, and large— comprising 80, 500, and 10,000 questions, respectively.The smallest version is tailored for comparisons between different LLMs and humans. The CyberMetric-80 dataset has been subject to testing with 30 human participants, enabling an effective comparison between human and machine intelligence.


# Architecture

The CyberMetric dataset is created using different LLMs and validated by human experts. The AI-driven generation framework is illustrated in the following figure.

# Results

We evaluated several well-known LLMs, including GPT-4, FALCON-180B, GEMINI-Pro, and Mixtral-8x7B.

# Usage

We have developed a compact Python script called `CyberMetric_evaluator.py` to showcase how to utilize the Dataset with OpenAI GPT. Simply insert your API key in the script by setting `API_KEY="<YOUR-API-KEY-HERE>"`, and then execute the evaluator program.


Here's an example output generated by the script using the CyberMetric-80 dataset:
